# Percentage Clock
A simple desktop GUI to display the current time as a percentage throught the day.

The clock displays the current time as a percentage of two different time ranges:
- Total Day - Starting and ending at mindnight
- Work Day - The start time and duration of a work shift set by the user

The user can edit the Work Day via the hidden toolbar,
which can be expanded by pressing the "+" button at the top-left of the GUI.

The GUI defaults to "Always On Top" which keeps it above all other windows.
This feature can be toggled in the "View" menu of the toolbar.

While this application will work on multiple operating systems, it is targeted towards Windows.
It therefore may have some bugs on other systems. 

This application was written in python 3.12.3
